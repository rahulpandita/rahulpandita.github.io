Bio
----

Hi all…

I am Rahul Pandita postdoctoral researcher at [Department of Computer Science NCSU](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) working with [Dr. Laurie Williams](http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/) and [Dr. Munindar Singh](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/mpsingh/).
I received my [PhD.](./files/diploma.pdf) from [NCSU](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) in Computer Science.
I like to travel, love to sketch, and enjoy music. Learning to me is a never ending process.
And I believe that “There is so much more left to be done...”. 
I strongly believe that there is always room for improvement ...

Contact me at rpandit ~ 'at' ~ ncsu ~ 'dot' ~ edu.
