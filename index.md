Bio
================================

Hi all…

I am Rahul Pandita postdoctoral researcher at Department of Computer Science NCSU working with Dr. Laurie Williams and Dr. Munindar Singh. I received my PhD. from NCSU in Computer Science. I like to travel, love to sketch, and enjoy music. Learning to me is a never ending process. And I believe that “There is so much more left to be done...”. I strongly believe that there is always room for improvement ...
